Description: Joomla CMS
 A Openpanel OpenApp meta-package for Joomla. This does not carry the actual Joomla source,
 but just makes sure that it is installed and upgraded if necessary. It detects the current
 version of Joomla and thus can see if you upgraded via the webinterface.
 .
 This package is built for openapp, but can be used without openapp. Do note though, that upon
 install, /var/www will be emptied after a backup has been made into /var/backups/.
 .
 Please see http://www.openpanel.com/openapp/ for more info.
